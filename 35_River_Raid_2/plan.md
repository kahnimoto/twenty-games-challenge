## The Enemies:

### Tanker

A very large boat which sits in the water.  As they are large targets
they are relatively slow moving and net only 30 points when defeated.  Tankers
will bounce between shore line to shore line.  While they are large targets,
that also means it is difficult to shoot around them, which becomes something
you will need to do later in the game

### Helicopter
Much smaller than tankers, helicopters are also a bit faster and
harder to avoid, they yield sixty points when defeated.  They will travel from
one side of the screen to the other, when they exit one side, they will enter
on the other.

### Jet
These enemies move very quickly from the left and right sides of the
screen exiting on the other.  They are difficult to hit by shooting but always
seem to run into you at the most in-opportune time.  They give 100 points when
defeated.

## Bridge

Bridges are used to separate sections of the "level".  I use the term
level as there really are not any aside from the first, which is also 
apparently endless.  Bridges do not move, though after a while they will appear
after nasty tight turns making them nearly impossible to shoot without first
colliding into them and losing a life.  A bridge gives 500 points, but more
importantly, once beyond the point where a destroyed bridge is, in the event
your plane is destroyed, you will start from there, rather than the beginning
of the game, which is good as it is just one giant level.

## Fuel Refill Depot
As your plane obviously needs some sort of gas to keep it
going, you will need to collect these frequently.  While you can shoot them for
80 points, it is usually a good idea to touch them and start refilling first.
If you are going slow enough, you can actually refill and then blow up the 
depot you are refilling at.  If you are low on fuel, do not pass one of these
up, there is no telling when you may see another.  Remember to hold the joy
stick down when passing over
